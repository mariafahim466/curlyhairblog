   <p class="first">Even after all the compliments (and random people touching your hair),
	 you probably still dread managing your hair everyday! But don't worry, I'm in the same boat. 
	 I understand the struggles when it comes to styling your curls. </p>
<p>The difference between good and bad hair days is a
	 good hair care routine. That's right, and it's actually easier than you think. With the
	  right products and ways to style, you can take your curls to the next level and boost
	   your confidence through the roof!</p>

	  <blockquote>
		<p class="blotie"><strong>Advice from an Expert</strong></p>
		<p>"Natural oils are a rich source of vitamin E and fatty acids. These fatty acids help to lock the moisture in your hair.
			 That's how natural oils control frizz and improve the manageability of curly hair. Massaging natural oils on the
			  scalp boosts blood circulation and promotes hair growth"</p>

<h3 id="one">1. Identify your hair type</h3>

<p>Different hair types require different products and routines, there's not 
	one routine out there that works for all hair types. For example, 4C curls will require different 
	care steps than 2A curls. I will be focusing more in depth on 3a-3c curls since 
this is what I am most familiar with.</p>

<p>Use the image guide below to identify which hair type suits you best!</p>

<h3 id="two">2. Creating an effective wash routine</h3>

<p>Since you don't want to be washing your hair every single day, a strong routine every few days is pretty important
	 for your hair to last long and look its best. When washing your scalp it's recommended that you do it 1-2 times 
	 a week, any more and your hair will probably start getting dry. </p>

<p>While washing, wash thoroughly with a reasonable amount of shampoo making sure to be gentle whiiel rubbing 
	the shampoo onto your scalp. There's no need to rub the shampoo directly into the rest of your hair, just 
	into the scalp and let it coat the rest of your hair while you wash it out</p>

<p>The next step is to add conditioner and detangle. When you add the conditioner, add it to the middle and bottom
	 of your hair but don't apply it directly to the roots.</p>

<p>After applying conditioner, wait at least two minutes before washing it out. Then, this step is
	 optional but if you have a deep conditioner, now would be the time to add it. Leave that in for about 5 
	 minutes before washing it out.</p>


	 	<h3 id="three">3. When and how to detangle your hair</h3>

	 <h4>When</h4>
	 
	 <p>Arguably the biggest takeaway when learning about curly hair is that you should only ever brush it while 
		 it's wet. I like to brush it two minutes after applying conditioner while I'm still in the shower, but I 
		 know other people do it right after they get out too, either way works. Try out both and see which you like 
		 the best. A big part of the process in finding a new curly hair routine is taking the risk of trying something 
		 new, and it might work or it might not, but you must try new things to find what's best for your curls!</p>
	 
	 <h4>How</h4>
	 
	 <p>Personally, I've wasted money on lots of different brushes over the years, but what I find works best is
		  a wide tooth comb for detangling, and a denman brush for styling. Bonus points if the comb is wooden!
		   Wooden combs are better at distributing your scalps natural oils throughout the entire hair strand. 
		   The main benefit to using a wide tooth comb is that you're not going to be losing as much hair while detangling</p>
	 
	 <p>Also, always brush from the bottom to the top to prevent unneccesary breakage</p>



	 <h3 id="four">4. Styling and drying your curls</h3>

	 <h4>Styling while wet</h4>
	 
	 <p>Separating into sections when styling is pretty important because it allows for all
		  the product to be evenly distributed, and for maximum definition and volume.  
		  Although it takes longer, this is reccommended as you'll notice it will pay off later because your curls 
		  will stay fresh for longer.</p>
		  <p>It's also a good idea to seal your curls and products in with some gel. Just a small amount 
			 will do, and when it's dry, add some oil to your hands
			 and separate your curls to maximize volume and definition!</p>
		  </p>
	 
	 <h4>Drying</h4>
	 
	 <p>If you haven't used a diffuser yet, your life is about to change. The added volume and definition 
		 a diffuser provides is going to be a little different than styling without a diffuser. Watch the video below
		  to get a better idea as to how and when to use a diffuser!</p>
	 
	 <p>An alternate way if you wish to not use heat, is to style and then dry it with a t-shirt.
		  This method is called "plopping". It involves tying your hair into a t-shirt after styling instead 
		  of drying it with a towel so it doesn't add any extra frizz. Watch the video below to know how to properly plop.
		   It might take a few tries to get right but don't worry, it's really not as complicated as it looks.</p>



		   <h3 id="five">5. Applying product the right way</h3>

		   <p>When styling your hair, you want to make sure to apply the majority of it from the middle to the bottom, and trying your 
			   best to avoid the scalp.
		   </p>
	   
	   <p>But why is this? For two main reasons. The first being that applying product to your roots contributes to product 
		   build up on your scalp, which leads to dandruff and an itchy scalp. The second reason is that adding excess product to your 
		   roots will weigh your curls down, taking away from its overall volume. 
	   </p>
	   
	   <p>When applying your product, the ideal time is when it is still wet for example after a shower. While still wet, 
		   rub your product on your hands 
	   </p>


	   <h3 id="six">6. How to prevent frizz</h3>

<img src="https://thecuriousjalebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Untitled-design-5.png" class="pics" alt="before and after learning about
preventing frizz"/>

<p class="image">Image: The Curious Jalebi</p>


	   <p>One misunderstood idea when it comes to curly hair is that you have to choose between frizzy curls with volume, or no volume but have definition. Well,
			what if I told 
		   you that you can have both? 
	   </p>
 
	   <p>It is certainly not impossible, and I will explain the steps I take to ensure I achieve volume with very
		minimal frizz. When styling your
			hair while wet, you want to find the amount of product that won't weigh your hair down but also won't
			 leave it too poofy. Your hair will weigh 
			itself down if too much product is added, and will be too poofy if not enough product is added. So, 
			how do you find that magic amount? 
			Well, you experiment for yourself! It won't be perfect each time, but eventually you will get into a
			 habit of around how much you should be 
			adding to get your desired results.
	   </p>
 
	   <p>Another great way to prevent frizz is by using a gel product. Once again, you don't want to add too much 
		   so your hair's flat, and not too
		   little so that it's not effective. Just scrunch it into your hair as the final step, and once your hair
			is dry, apply some oil to your hands and separate your curls 
		   to your liking. The more you separate, the more voluminous it will be so keep that in mind. 
	   </p>
 
	   <p>And finally, the best way to prevent frizz is to NOT TOUCH YOUR HAIR. It's okay to say no to 
		strangers pulling your hair apart. This is only adding to your frizz. After your hair is dry do not touch
		it unless you're using oil on your hands. This is because using an oil while separating curls won't add frizz
		if done gently.
	   </p>



<h3 id="seven">7. Which products are worth it?</h3>

<p>Go for brands that are marketed towards curly hair and that use words/phrases like: "for dry and coarse hair"
	or "helps manage frizz" etc... these will be the ones you should grab off the shelves. There's also no need 
	to drive far away for products, you can find all the necessary products at local drug stores and grocery stores 
	(and are likely cheaper too!).</p>

	<p>Brands such as: Aussie, Shea Moisture, Garnier Fructis, and OGX are some examples of brands that 
		make exceptional curly hair products 
		that you may want to consider.
	</p>

<p>Take the time to check ingredients while shopping for
	 new products. You want to avoid ones with:</p>
	<ul class="avoid">
		<li class="avoid">Parabens</li>
		<li class="avoid">Sulfates</li>
		<li class="avoid">Drying alcohols</li>
		<li class="avoid">DMDM Hydantoin</li>
		<li class="avoid">Silicones</li>
	</ul>
<p>These ingredients will not benefit your hair, they have been known to have uneccesary chemicals,
	 and to weaken the hair so try to avoid these ones if possible. It also doesn't hurt to ask other
	  people around you with curly hair what they're using to gain more knowledge on the subject.</p>


	 
	

	  <h3 id="eight">8. How often should you switch your routine?</h3>

	  <p>If you notice that after a period of time your hair products just aren't giving your hair
		  the results they gave before, then this is the perfect time 
		  to try something new! The amount of time depends, for some it could be a few weeks and for others
		  it may be months or even years.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>So this will really be a personal choice that you can make after observing how the product affects 
		  your hair. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>You should also consider switching your routine after getting it cut a new way, or applying any chemical dye onto it. 
		  This is because you will
		  likely need to change the way you style it, or the products you're using won't benefit your hair anymore.
	  </p>
	  
	  
	  
	  <p>Don't forget that bad hair days are inevitable. There's not one routine out there that will work 100% of the time, so be patient
		  and consistent with trial and error. Never give up on your beautiful curls!
	  </p>
	  


	




<h3 id="nine">9. Sleeping with your curls</h3>

<p>There are multiple ways to sleep at night to maintain your curls. A few popular options are:</p>

<ul class="avoid">
	<li class="avoid">A bonnet</li>
	<li class="avoid">Silk scarf</li>
	<li class="avoid">Silk pillowcase</li>
</ul>

	<p>A bonnet is a great option that I would recommend to almost anybody. It is very commonly used within the curly hair 
		community because it's comfortable, and easy to put on. It also will most likely not fall off in
		 the night which is a huge bonus! The two cons I have noticed about it is that over time the band will stretch out, 
		 and that you will wake up with your hair much shorter thus having to spend more time to adjust it.</p>

	<p>A silk scarf is something that many people may choose over the 
		bonnet because it is better at keeping your length overnight. The cons are that, in my experience, it has a tendency 
		to fall off in the night, and can be difficult at first to find out the best way to tie it.

		<p>Using a silk pillowcase is a great option as it feels the most natural when sleeping without anything physically 
			being on your head. This is the one I personally go for when sleeping because I wake up with my hair the same
			 as the night before. 
			I will tie it up in a simple bun on top of my head and just sleep on my silk pillowcase with nothing else,
			 and I always wake up with no 
			extra shrinkage that may come with a bonnet.
		</p>

		<p>I would recommend trying out different methods until you find the best one for you!</p>

	
<h3 id="ten">10. Which oils should you use?</h3>

-hair.webp" alt="hair oil" class="picstwo"/>

<p class="image">Image: Ambujasolvex</p>

<p>There's multiple oils out there marketed towards hair growth, but which ones work and are worth your 
	time and money?
</p>

<p>Based on my experience and research, the following oils are great for hair growth as well as 
	to keep the hair feeling soft and full to the touch. These include:
</p>

<p>Castor oil, Jojoba oil, Rosemary oil, Tea tree oil, Coconut oil, Olive oil, and Almond oil.</p>

<p>These oils have been proven to enhance the shine and strength of your hair, ultimately making it healthier. I would
	recommend doing more in depth research on this topic to gain a stronger understanding on each individual oil's purpose.
